# Rabitt-duck illusion as react bulletin board
A bulletin board in react, playing with the Rabitt-duck optical illusion and Thomas Kuhn's idea of scientific paradigm shift.

This is a review of Lynda.com's Up and Running with React tutorial with my own adjustments, following the patterin in react-notes.

Steps:
* set up index and supporting files, file structure
* generate empty background/bulletin board, board react component
* check react is working as expected
* make one note appear, note react component, the create function
* add buttons to note (edit, save etc)
* display hard-coded data, text & rabbit-duck image
* make multiple notes appear from hard-coded data
* enable editing and saving
* add randomizer to shift rotation and location of notes
* automatically populate many notes 
* add interactive features, guessing if it's a rabbit or a duck etc
